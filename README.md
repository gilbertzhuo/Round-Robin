# Round-Robin

Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.
![Program](https://github.com/gilbertzhuo/Round-Robin/blob/main/Image/project.png?raw=true)

- Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.
- Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. Turn Around Time - Completion Time – Arrival Time
- Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
- Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time
